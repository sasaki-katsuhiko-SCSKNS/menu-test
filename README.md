# YNA G3 Front Blnak Project

This template should help get you started developing with YNA G3. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

## Install VSCode
VSCode is the recommended IDE for front end app development.
Download VSCode from the [official site](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Install following extensions:
- Vue - Official
- Eslint
- ...

## Install Node.js
Download Node.js from [official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Version 20 is recommended.

## Configure node js
Viy modules are store in Github Packages, so access token is required for downloading modules. Edit `.npmrc` file, add following lines:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=ghp_ddd
@ymsl-x:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
@ymc-group:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

The .npmrc file can be located in two places:
- User-level configuration: Located in your user's home directory (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.npmrc`).
- Project-level configuration: Located in the root directory of your project.

If the file does not exist, you can create a new text file and rename it to .npmrc.

Replace `ghp_ddd` with your own access token(with at least `package:read` permission).
> **Note**: `//npm.pkg.github.com/` does not mean comment, it is part of the url.

## Install necessary packages
Run ```npm i -g pnpm``` for installing package manager `pnpm` globaly.
Then go to the root directory of your project, run ```pnpm install``` for installing all the dependencies.

### Change registry url
Default node js uses ```http://registry.npmjs.org``` for downloading modules.
This is ok for developers from Japan or India, but might be slow for developers in China.
In this case, registry can be changed to a Chinese mirror registry.
```
npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
```

## Clone Project
Clone this repository or download zip to your local machine.

## Modify package.json
Edit the package.json file to update the project information with your own details:

```json
{
  "name": "your-project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Your project description",
  "author": "Your Name <your.email@example.com>"
}
```

## Start app
Run ```pnpm run dev``` to start app.
Access ```http://localhost:5000/``` to view the page.

### Login
By default, the login process will use the login API of solid backend. Please confirm that the backend has been properly configured and started. The default username and password are `admin` and `user`.

### Dummy login
If you temporally don't have backend API for login, you can add following settings in `menuSetting.js` to enable dummy login.

```javascript
const { login, logout, getUserInfo, getMenusByEnv } = new YnaG3SystemAdapter({
  dummyAuth: import.meta.env.MODE !== 'production' && { userCode: 'admin' }, // add this line for dummy login, this line will not be included in production build
});
```

## Proxy
proxy settings can be found in ```vite.config.js```.
```javascript
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/blank': {
        target: 'http://localhost:8080',
        changeOrigin: true,
      },
      '/blank/websocket': {
        target: 'ws://localhost:8080',
        ws: true,
        changeOrigin: true,
      },
    },
  },
```
All the requests to ```/blank``` will be redirected to ```http://localhost:8080```. e.g. `/blank/api/findData` would be sent to `http://localhost:8080/blank/api/findData`.
Websocket should be configured separately, with `ws: true` option.

## Build
Run `pnpm run build` to build app.
The built files will be in `dist` folder.
